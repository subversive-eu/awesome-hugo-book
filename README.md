### Goal

- Deploy a full documentation about fundamentals and tricks.

-> Make life easier and faster for hugo webmaster ! (because i'm one of them and sometimes we need to stock list, like hard list !).

### Project

- Come from <https://subversive-eu.github.io/book-seo/>, it's in french, but using jekyll (hate it!) and a lot of errors and not full !
- Just want a website bookmarks ! nothing more.
- Do not think, join me, just to send a link, this can help.
